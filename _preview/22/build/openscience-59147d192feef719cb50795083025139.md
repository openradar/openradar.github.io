# Open Science 

Open science is the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science)).

## Open Radar Science 

In order to make open science work, each community has to develop specific solutions. [openradarscience.org](https://openradarscience.org) aims to provide a collaborative platform to develop, share and integrate free and open source community software for weather radar data processing.

## Open source: a necessary, not a sufficient condition

We are aware that open source software is only one component of open science: consider it a necessary, not a sufficient condition to make research transparent and reproducible. It should come along with efforts to also make radar data open. That is why we will also try to collect information about open access to weather radar data products. Can you help us? Have a look at our [open data page](opendata.md).
